    "# Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use\n",
    "# MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "# MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. It is a non-relational database,\n",
    "# meaning it does not require a fixed schema like SQL databases. MongoDB is preferred in scenarios where:\n",
    "# - There is a need for flexibility in data structure\n",
    "# - Scalability and high availability are important\n",
    "# - Rapid development and iteration are required\n",
    "# - Applications deal with large volumes of data with varying structures\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Features of MongoDB include:\n",
    "# - Document-Oriented: Data is stored in flexible JSON-like documents\n",
    "# - High Performance: Supports indexing, sharding, and replication for scalability and performance\n",
    "# - Dynamic Schema: No need to predefine schema; fields can vary from document to document\n",
    "# - Scalability: Easily scales out across multiple servers\n",
    "# - Rich Query Language: Supports a wide range of queries including field, range, and regular expression searches\n",
    "# - Geospatial Queries: Supports geospatial indexes and queries for location-based data\n",
    "# - Aggregation Framework: Provides aggregation pipeline for complex data processing tasks\n",
    "# - Flexible Deployment: Can be deployed on-premise or in the cloud\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q3. Write a code to connect MongoDB to Python. Also, create a database and a collection in MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "from pymongo import MongoClient\n",
    "\n",
    "# Connect to MongoDB\n",
    "client = MongoClient('localhost', 27017)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a database\n",
    "db = client['mydatabase']\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a collection\n",
    "collection = db['mycollection']\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q4. Using the database and the collection created in question number 3, write a code to insert one record,\n",
    "# and insert many records. Use the find() and find_one() methods to print the inserted record.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Insert one record\n",
    "record = {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30, \"city\": \"New York\"}\n",
    "result = collection.insert_one(record)\n",

    "print(\"Inserted records:\")\n",
    "for doc in collection.find():\n",
    "    print(doc)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q5. Explain how you can use the find() method to query the MongoDB database. Write a simple code to\n",
    "# demonstrate this.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The find() method is used to query documents in a MongoDB collection. It returns a cursor object that can be iterated\n",
    "# over to retrieve documents that match the query criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "# Find documents where age is greater than 30\n",
    "for doc in collection.find({\"age\": {\"$gt\": 30}}):\n",
    "    print(doc)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q6. Explain the sort() method. Give an example to demonstrate sorting in MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The sort() method is used to sort the results of a query in MongoDB. It takes one or more fields and their sorting\n",
    "# order (ascending or descending).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "# Sort documents by age in ascending order\n",
    "result = collection.find().sort(\"age\", 1)\n",
    "for doc in result:\n",
    "    print(doc)\n",

    "# Q7. Explain why delete_one(), delete_many(), and drop() is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "# - delete_one(): Deletes a single document that matches the specified criteria.\n",
    "# - delete_many(): Deletes multiple documents that match the specified criteria.\n",
    "# - drop(): Drops the entire collection, including all of its documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "# These methods are used to remove data from a MongoDB collection based on specific criteria or to remove the entire collection.\n"
